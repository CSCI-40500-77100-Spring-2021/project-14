**Tuesday, 2/23/2021:**  

Meet again to go over our prototype ideas and select what to show on Wednesday

The "first-page.jpg" is the initial page of our product. From there we would render the page you are witnessing in index.html. Since we are just learning more about JavaScript, APIs and how web applications work, we could not implement first-page accordingly in or prototype but plan to do so on our final implementation.
