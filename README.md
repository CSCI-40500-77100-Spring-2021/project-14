### Group 14:

Nirmala Kuhl

For the second release:
* (Nirmala) Added initial **database design describing SQL tables and datatypes** needed. See diagram here: design/DBDesign 1.0.png
* (Nirmala) Added php script that allows developers to **create this database and all tables** on their development machines. Script can be found here: php/createDatabase.php
  (PS: this will also be used to set up a small server here so we can demonstrate the whole project "in production" later)
